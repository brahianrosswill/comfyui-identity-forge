"""IdentityForgeCosplayer node — fictional characters as a worn cosplay look.

Pick (or randomize) a fictional character and emit a JSON document of overrides.
Wire its ``character_json`` output into the ``archetype_json`` input of an
:class:`~nodes.identity_forge.IdentityForge` node. The character's costume defines
the *look* and IdentityForge randomizes the person underneath, so every run is a
different individual cosplaying the same character.

Presets chain: connect another preset's ``character_json`` into the optional
``upstream`` input and they stack into one document (this node wins on overlap),
so Archetype and Cosplayer nodes can all stay wired at once. Set a node to
``None`` and it simply passes its upstream through.

Two look levels:

* **Costume only** (default) — only the costume and a few signature look traits
  (hair, eyes) are sent, so body, face, and demographics stay free to randomize.
  This is the "a random person cosplaying X" mode.
* **Full character** — also locks the character's physique (body type, height,
  skin tone, …) for a faithful reproduction; the scene still randomizes.

Full-mask characters (``covers_face``) carry their head covering in a separate
``mask`` field. The node's ``mask`` widget defaults to keeping it on (face/hair
suppressed); ``"Unmask (show face)"`` drops it so the randomized head shows under
the suit — a helmet-off look. It is a no-op for face-visible characters.

The *person's* gender is chosen on the IdentityForge node, independent of the
character's, so crossplay (e.g. a man cosplaying a female character) works: the
downstream gender gate drops any value invalid for the chosen gender. The source
character's gender here only scopes the "Random — female / male" picks.

The engine half (:func:`build_cosplayer_json`) is a pure function, testable
without ComfyUI.
