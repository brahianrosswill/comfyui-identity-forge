"""Creature dataset for IdentityForge — a non-human *form* layer.

Each entry describes a creature as a set of **anatomy slots** that can be worn by
a character: a head, eyes, an integument (skin / fur / scales / chitin / shell), and
optional limbs, tail, wings and extra features. The Creature node picks one creature
(or hybridizes several — a praying-mantis body with a sloth's head) and emits a
``Species & Anatomy`` JSON group plus suppression flags that tell IdentityForge which
human fields to drop. Everything not replaced (a wired costume, the surviving human
body, the scene) still composes.

Schema per entry (keyed by creature name)::

    "praying mantis": {
        "class":      "Insects & Arachnids",  # which "Random - <class>" pool it joins
        "palette":    "emerald",               # default colour, applied to the integument
        "head":       "a triangular mantis head with swiveling antennae",
        "eyes":       "large bulbous compound eyes",
        "integument": "a segmented chitinous exoskeleton",   # colour-free; palette colours it
        "arms":       "raptorial spiked forelimbs",          # optional
        "hands":      "barbed grasping claws",               # optional
        "legs_feet":  "thin spined insectoid legs",          # optional
        "tail":       None,                                   # optional
        "wings":      "a folded pair of translucent wing-cases",  # optional
        "extras":     "a slender segmented abdomen",          # optional
    }

Curation rules (so the data stays coherent with the engine):

* **Slots are prose-ready phrases**, voiced after "... with" / "It has ...". A
  singular slot carries its article ("a triangular mantis head"); a mass/plural slot
  does not ("large compound eyes", "shaggy fur"). They are *not* validated against
  ``data/fields.py`` — the species group is rendered by its own prose path, which is
  what frees non-humans from the human field pools.
* **The integument is colour-free.** Leave the hue out of ``integument`` and put it in
  ``palette`` — the node prepends the palette (and any finish) onto the integument, so a
  user can recolour it ("crimson" instead of "emerald") without fighting baked-in text.
  Texture words (chitinous, scaled, furred, plated) stay in ``integument``.
* **Amorphous / colour-variable creatures may add an optional ``palette_pool``** — a list
  of hues. With the node's palette on ``Auto`` it draws a seed-varied colour from this pool
  instead of the single ``palette`` (so a blob alien is not always cyan); ``palette`` stays
  as the required fallback. Use it only where many colours are plausible (blobs, slimes,
  energy beings, jellyfish, crystals), not for naturalistic animals whose colour is fixed.
* ``head`` and ``integument`` drive suppression: a creature head hides the human
  Face / Hair / Makeup; a creature integument hides the human skin fields. ``arms`` /
  ``hands`` / ``legs_feet`` have no human field to hide (the body is humanoid under an
  anthro form) — they simply add description.
* **Required slots:** ``class``, ``palette``, ``head``, ``eyes``, ``integument``.
  The rest are optional; set them to ``None`` or omit them when not iconic.
* **Plain ASCII only.** Slot text reaches the prompt, so avoid em/en dashes, smart
  quotes and ellipses (use ``-``, ``'``, ``...``) — some tokenizers mangle them.

This is a curated starter set spanning every class; add more incrementally (here or via
the ``creatures`` section of ``user_options.json``). ``tests/validate_data.py`` checks
the structure.
