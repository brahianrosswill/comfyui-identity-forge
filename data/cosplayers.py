"""Cosplayer dataset for IdentityForge — fictional characters as a *worn look*.

Each entry describes a character the way a **cosplayer** wears them: the costume
(and any signature non-human features rendered as body paint / prosthetics /
headpieces) is captured as text, while the person underneath is free to
randomize. This is what lets the Cosplayer node put "2B's outfit" on an
ever-changing — and optionally cross-gender — person.

Schema per entry (keyed by character name)::

    "2B": {
        "franchise": "NieR: Automata",   # shown in the cosplay label
        "gender":    "Female",            # SOURCE character gender — for Random scoping only
        "covers_face": True,              # OPTIONAL — full mask/helmet: drop the randomized
                                          #   face/hair/makeup so only the costume shows
        "mask":      "a full face mask ...",# REQUIRED when covers_face — the head covering,
                                          #   kept apart from costume so the node's "Unmask"
                                          #   toggle can drop it and reveal the random head
        "costume":   "a gothic black ...",# → IdentityForge's hidden outfit_description
        "signature": {                    # iconic, field-mappable look — applied in BOTH modes
            "hair_color": "platinum blonde", "hair_length": "chin length bob",
            "hair_style": "blunt bangs",
        },
        "physique":  {                    # body/skin/height — applied ONLY in "Full character" mode
            "body_type": "slender", "height": "average height", "skin_tone": "porcelain",
        },
    }

Curation rules (so the data stays coherent with the engine):

* **Worn, not held.** ``costume`` lists only *worn* items — clothing, footwear,
  gloves, masks/cowls, headwear, hair bows, jewellery, belts, empty holsters,
  body paint, markings, capes. Held / wielded props (swords, staves, bows, guns,
  shields, wands) stay *out* of ``costume``.
* **Signature props (optional, opt-in).** A character with a *truly iconic* held
  prop may carry it in an optional ``"prop"`` key — a free-text phrase that reads
  naturally after "holding …" (e.g. ``"Mjolnir, a short-handled rectangular war
  hammer with a worn leather grip"``). It is emitted only when the Cosplayer node's
  prop toggle is on (off by default), as the hidden ``held_item`` lock. Describe it
  richly and distinctively like a costume — shape, colours, materials, markings —
  not as a bare noun, and keep the same plain-ASCII style. Most characters have no
  signature prop: omit the key entirely rather than inventing one.
* ``costume`` reads naturally after "She/He wears …" (it is voiced verbatim as
  the outfit), so it starts lowercase with an article.
* ``signature`` / ``physique`` keys must be real :data:`data.fields.FIELD_DEFINITIONS`
  fields and every value must be a valid option for that field. Prefer unisex
  fields (hair, eyes, body) so the look survives the downstream gender gate for
  crossplay. ``tests/validate_data.py`` enforces this.
* Non-human characters are included: their non-mappable features (green/blue/
  orange skin, montrals, antennae, wings, scales) live in ``costume`` as worn
  cosplay elements, and ``skin_tone`` is left out so the person underneath
  randomizes.
* **Body paint reads as a single even coat.** A solid non-natural skin colour is
  worded ``"an even, smooth coat of <colour> body paint"`` (drop "all-over") so
  text-to-image models render it uniform instead of patchy/streaked. Keep "paint"
  (it layers over the randomized skin without contradicting the spoken skin tone).
  Where the surface has an intrinsic texture/pattern, anchor on the same even coat
  and append it: scales/fur use ``"an even, all-over coat of …"`` and keep
  "scaled-skin" / "fur"; markings, tattoos and plating follow as ``"… with <pattern>"``.
* **Full masks/helmets** (Spider-Man, a Mandalorian helmet, a ninja hood) set
  ``"covers_face": True`` so IdentityForge drops the randomized face, hair and
  makeup that would otherwise be described fighting the mask. Omit it whenever
  the face is visible (an open cowl, body-painted-but-visible face, domino mask).
  Every ``covers_face`` entry also puts its head covering in a separate ``mask``
  string (kept *out* of ``costume``): in the default mode the node re-attaches it
  to the costume, but the Cosplayer node's ``Unmask`` toggle drops it and clears
  ``covers_face`` so the randomized head/hair shows under the suit. ``mask`` reads
  naturally as one more worn item appended after the costume (lowercase, with an
  article); face-visible characters have no ``mask``.
* **Plain ASCII only.** Costume text and the character name reach the prompt, so
  avoid em/en dashes, smart quotes and ellipses (use ``-``, ``'``, ``...``);
  some text-to-image tokenizers mangle them.

This is a curated starter set; new characters can be added incrementally — just
follow the schema and keep values valid against ``data/fields.py``.
