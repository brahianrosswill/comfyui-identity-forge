"""Optional user-supplied dropdown options (survive ``git pull``).

Drop a ``user_options.json`` in the pack root to add choices without editing the
source — so updates won't clobber them. Two sections, both optional::

Reload the node / restart ComfyUI to apply. Notes:

* ``fields`` extends a dropdown's options. Every field can be extended *except*
  the control fields (``gender``, ``hair_color_scope``, ``location_setting``)
  and ``outfit_style`` / ``outfit_description`` — those are coupled to garment
  text and must go through the ``outfits`` section instead (see below).
* ``outfits`` adds a whole new outfit *style*: it registers the garment text
  **and** adds the style name to the ``outfit_style`` dropdown in one step, so
  the style can never be selected without clothing to back it. Buckets are
  ``unisex`` / ``female`` / ``male`` (any subset); ``unisex`` is always eligible,
  the gendered buckets are chosen by the ``wardrobe`` control. A style with no
  usable garment strings is skipped (it would otherwise emit an empty outfit).
* Custom hair colours appear only under the ``Full spectrum`` scope.
* For the three gender-specific fields (``bust``, ``facial_hair``,
  ``makeup_style``) custom options may not survive a live gender switch in the UI.
* ``archetypes`` adds presets to the Archetype node (same ``{field: value}``
  shape as the built-ins; ``outfit_description`` may use ``{slot}`` costume
  placeholders). ``cosplayers`` adds characters to the Cosplayer node (keys:
  ``franchise``, ``gender`` Female/Male, ``costume`` text, optional ``signature``
  / ``physique`` ``{field: value}`` maps). A user entry whose name matches a
  built-in overrides it. Run ``python tests/validate_data.py`` to check that your
  field values are valid options.
* **Masked characters (the ``mask`` flow — easy to get wrong).** For a full
  helmet/mask, set ``"covers_face": true`` *and* put the head covering in a
  separate ``"mask"`` string, keeping it **out** of ``costume`` (note the
  "Masked Vigilante" example above). ``covers_face`` hides the randomized
  face/hair so only the costume shows; the ``mask`` is appended to the costume in
  the node's default mode, but kept separate so its ``Unmask (show face)`` toggle
  can drop the mask and reveal the random head under the suit. Omit both
  ``covers_face`` and ``mask`` whenever the face is visible (an open cowl, body
  paint, a domino mask).
