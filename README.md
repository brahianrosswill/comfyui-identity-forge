# ComfyUI Identity Forge

**Endless, coherent characters from dropdowns — no prompt-wrangling.** Queue once for a
believable person; queue again for a brand-new one. Identity Forge turns menu choices into clean
natural-language prose (for CLIP Text Encode) plus a structured JSON record — with a constraint
engine that keeps every result sensible: no beard on the buzz-cut, no handbag with the gym kit,
no Irish ancestry rendered in ebony skin. Lock the few traits you care about, let the rest roll.

**Why you'll like it**

- **Coherent by design** — a constraint engine resolves clashing traits for you, automatically.
- **Reproducible** — seed-driven, so any character you like comes back exactly.
- **Archetypes & cosplayers** — a deep library of themed looks and fictional-character costumes
  dropped onto an ever-changing person, with crossplay and a helmet-off *Unmask* toggle.
- **Creature layer** — render the character as an animal / monster / alien, *hybridized
  slot-by-slot* (a praying-mantis body with a sloth's head), anthropomorphic, feral or a subtle accent.
- **Chainable** — Archetype → Cosplayer → Creature → Modifier → Identity Forge stack instead of
  fighting over one socket; a **character vault** saves and recalls the ones you love.
- **Zero dependencies, fully offline** — no LLM, no API keys, no model downloads.

Built on the ComfyUI **V3 API** (`comfy_api.latest`). Category: `conditioning/character`.

## Showcase

Chain the preset nodes into the main Identity Forge node — the node **closest to Identity Forge
wins** any conflict:

## The nodes

| Node | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity Forge** | Lockable dropdowns in collapsible groups + the constraint engine → `prompt_text` (prose) and `prompt_json`. |
| **Archetype** | Themed presets (knight, sorceress, pirate, samurai, pop star, astronaut, surgeon, 1950s homemaker…) that set the *look* while the person randomizes. |
| **Cosplayer** | Fictional characters (Spider-Man, 2B, She-Hulk, Zelda…) as a *cosplay look* — the costume on a random, optionally cross-gender person. |
| **Creature** | Render the character as a non-human form (animal, insect, marine, reptile, bird, monster, alien, mythic, plant), across all classes or one, hybridized slot-by-slot. |
| **Modifier** | Prepend a custom descriptor to one field (`footwear: sci-fi`) or a whole group (`Clothing: weathered`). |
| **Vault Save / Load** | Save a generated character (with a thumbnail) to a local vault; recall it later as a chainable preset, with a Manage Vault gallery. |

---

## Install

Clone into `custom_nodes` and restart ComfyUI (no Python dependencies):

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfyui-identity-forge
```

Or install via **ComfyUI Manager** (search *Identity Forge*).

## Quick start

1. Add **Identity Forge**, connect `prompt_text` → **CLIP Text Encode**.
2. Leave fields on `Random`, or pick a value to lock the ones you care about.
3. Queue. The seed auto-randomizes, so each run is a new character (set the seed control to
   *fixed* to reproduce one).

---

## Chaining presets

The Archetype, Cosplayer, Creature and Modifier nodes all feed Identity Forge's single
`archetype_json` socket. Instead of swapping plugs, chain them through each node's optional
`upstream` input:

```
Archetype ─▶ Cosplayer ─▶ Creature ─▶ Modifier ─(character_json)─▶ Identity Forge.archetype_json
```

- **The node closest to Identity Forge wins** where fields overlap; non-overlapping upstream
  values survive.
- Set any node to `None` and it passes its upstream through — keep every preset wired and just
  toggle which is active.

The headline combo: a Cosplayer in front of a Creature gives *Superman as an anthropomorphic
praying-mantis hybrid with a sloth's head* — the costume survives, the body becomes the creature.

---

## Must-know

- **Seed** auto-randomizes each run; set it to *fixed* to reproduce a character. Not written to the JSON.
- **Every field is `Random` (roll) / a value (lock) / `None` (omit).** Set scene fields
  (`location`, `lighting`, framing) to `None` for a character-only description to splice elsewhere.
- **`accessory_density`** — drop it to `Minimal`/`None` for clean portraits without locking fields by hand.
- **Gender & crossplay.** The *person's* gender is the Identity Forge `gender` widget (independent
  of a character's). `Any` rolls a **coherent man or woman each run**; pair it with `wardrobe: Any`
  to unlock fully mixed-gender output. Locked / archetype / cosplayer values are always respected.
- **Scope the random character.** On the Cosplayer node, `random_scope` limits the `Random — …`
  picks to one franchise/category (Anime & Manga, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, …) and combines with gender.
- **Masked characters** (Spider-Man, a Mandalorian helmet) suppress the randomized face/hair so
  only the mask shows; the Cosplayer `Unmask` toggle reveals the head under the suit.
- **Vault** — *Vault Save* is a terminal node used like Save Image (branch `prompt_json` in,
  optionally the image for a thumbnail; mute it to skip). *Vault Load* recalls a save as a
  `character_json` that wires into `archetype_json`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **A `NoneType` error (or a missing/blank widget) after updating.** A node's fields are built when
  it is created, so a node on a saved graph can hold a stale widget after an update changes the
  options. **Recreate the node** - or delete and re-add it -  and the error clears. You may have to
  reselect any locked values after recreation (but it's worth it, because that means improvement!).

## Contributing characters & archetypes

Add private entries via `user_options.json` (see *Custom options* in
[docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md)) — or open an
[issue](https://github.com/EnragedAntelope/comfyui-identity-forge/issues) / PR proposing new
cosplayers, archetypes, outfit styles, creatures or fields to fold into the built-in set. For
cosplayers, a costume description (worn items only) and the franchise are enough to start; mark
`covers_face` + `mask` if the head is fully covered, and state baldness in the costume rather than
locking a hair length.

## Development

The engine runs without ComfyUI:

```bash
python tests/validate_data.py            # data integrity
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v  # engine + integration tests
```

`js/identity_forge.js` embeds data generated from `data/fields.py` — regenerate it only if you
change the gender-divergent fields or the field set.
